# Noodle, the new event scheduling tool

A work in progress. Scheduling events should be easy, respect your (and your guests') privacy, and ad-free.

Made with React, Firebase Real-time Database, React Router, and Bootstrap.

## Development

Clone repo, run `npm install`, then `npm start`. Then EITHER:

- Install Firebase locally following [these instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure). Start the database with `firebase emulators:start`, then proceed as usual.
